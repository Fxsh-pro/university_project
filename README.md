Welcome to our University project readme file! In this project, we aimed to create a secure password manager application using the Qt framework.

Our team believes that password management is a crucial aspect of online security, and we wanted to create an application that provides a simple and efficient solution to this problem. Our password manager allows users to securely store and manage their passwords for various online accounts.

The password manager application has several features, including password generation, password strength analysis, password encryption. sers can store their passwords in an encrypted format, and they can only be accessed with a master password.
